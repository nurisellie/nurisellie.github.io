# Starting Your Portfolio!

Your portfolio is an important part of your online presence -- it is the digital face you present to the world! It's really important to spend a lot of time thinking about the design of your portfolio, what you want to include, etc etc etc. That's why we're going to get started on your portfolio now, so that you have something to build on as the course continues.

Here are some examples of portfolios for you to look at:

- [J's short portfolio](https://jlr7245.github.io/)
- [J's longer portfolio](https://jsilv.works)
- [Kate's portfolio](https://shishkina.herokuapp.com/)
- [Charlie Gleason](https://charliegleason.com/)
- [Andrew McGill](http://www.andrewmcgill.me/assets/resume/)
- [Jacquard Loom](https://jacquard-loom.github.io/) -- not a portfolio but a good simple site
- [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/)
- [Semplice portfolio gallery](https://www.semplice.com/showcase)

## Getting Started

You'll be creating the repo for your portfolio _on github.com_, **NOT GitHub Enterprise**!!

We will be using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the site. Please read through the site and watch the videos before continuing on.

- Create a repo on Github named `yourusername.github.io`. For example, my GitHub.com username is `jlr7245`, so in the repository name field I would put `jlr7245.github.io`.
- When you push up code to this repo, make sure your `index.html` is at the root of the repo -- i.e. if you have a folder on your computer called `yourusername.github.io`, the file tree would look like this:

```bash
. # yourusernme.github.io
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ styles/
  â”œâ”€â”€ style.css
  â””â”€â”€ reset.css
```

- In settings, make sure that github pages is set up to track the master branch.

## Requirements!

- Must include an `index.html`, a `style.css`, and a `reset.css`
- Must include at least one image
- Must be styled using flexbox
- Must be hosted on GitHub Pages

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- An issue ticket created on _this repo_.
- The issue ticket should be formatted like [this](./.github/pull_request_template.md). It will format like this automatically. Replace everything in {curly braces} with your own values, for example [like this](https://gist.github.com/jlr7245/1e8f06e23731a32afea2fd0470370602)
- A link to your portfolio site on Github Pages

## This project is due ðŸš¨ 4PM on MONDAY, JULY 16 ðŸš¨

We will be working on it in class on Wednesday!
